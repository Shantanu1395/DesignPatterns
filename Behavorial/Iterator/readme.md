This contains the implementation of the iterator design pattern and how it can be used for reducing the code by providing a common interface.

Example Used-Pizza House Party

In this case I have used an example of a House Party in which pizza is being ordered from different pizza joints(PizzaHut,Dominoes and Mojo Pizza).

All the 3 pizza joins have different implementations of how pizza is stored(ArrayList,Arrays,HashMap) therefore a common interface is needed for extracting the information from the objects.
